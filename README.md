This repo is the modified version from https://github.com/fxia22/pointnet.pytorch/. Please consider visit the original work.
This version has been modified so that we can work with our custom datasets. The program will work well with files in .pts (representing cloud points of an object) and .seg (representing the labels of the cloud points).
